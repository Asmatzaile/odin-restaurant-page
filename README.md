# Restaurant page

This is the third project of the JavaScript Course from the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page)

It is a page for a fictitious restaurant serving quite strange foods.

It uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, and it is meant to practice creating a Webpack project and using JavaScript modules.

There's a hidden easter egg. It's quite easy to find it ;)

## Interface

Before starting with the development part, I designed the layout in Figma:
